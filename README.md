# P5 Data Visualization Project

This project is a very simple data visualization tool that leverages the power of the P5.js library. It is currently a standalone application, with future plans for expansion into a web application using React.js and Plotly.js.

## Overview

This application generates random outcomes from the given data set and presents these outcomes through simple and interactive visualizations. 

## Future Goals

The project is slated for significant expansion and refactoring. I plan on transitioning the codebase into a React.js application, allowing for component-based development. Plotly.js integration is also on the roadmap for providing more visualization options.

## Features

**Current Features:**

1. Random Data Generation: The application generates random outcomes based on the provided data set.
2. Simple Visualization: Support for straightforward visualization types.
3. Interactive Elements: Visualizations offer user interactivity.

**Planned Features:**

1. React.js Infrastructure: Component-based structure will lead to easier maintenance.
2. Plotly.js Integration: Offers a broader range of data visualization types.
3. Web Application: Transition into a fully-fledged web app, making it accessible to a wider audience.
