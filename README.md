P5 Data Visualization Project

This project is an engaging and minimalistic data visualization tool built using P5.js, a JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. Currently, it is a simple standalone application, but I have plans to expand this project into a more comprehensive web application using React.js and Plotly.js in the future.

Project Overview
The current iteration of the project offers interactive and straightforward visualizations of data. The application allows users to input their data sets and receive a visual output representing that data. While the current scope is limited, it provides an excellent foundation for future expansion.

Future Goals
The next steps for this project will involve refactoring the codebase into a React.js application, allowing for component-based development and state management. This step will provide a more flexible, efficient, and robust infrastructure for the project.

In addition to React.js, I plan on integrating Plotly.js to enhance the range of visualization options. Plotly.js is a high-level, declarative charting library that will open up a wide array of customizable data visualization possibilities, all while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

Current Features
Data Input: Users can input their own data for visualization.
Simple Visualization: The project currently supports straightforward visualization types.
Interactive Elements: Users can interact with the visualizations for a more in-depth understanding of their data.
Future Features
React.js Infrastructure: Component-based structure will lead to easier maintenance and more efficient development.
Plotly.js Integration: This will allow a broader range of data visualization types and enhanced customization.
Web Application: The ultimate goal is to transition this project into a full-fledged web app, making it accessible to a wider audience.
